# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

I take the security of the Question-Driven Talk Assistant seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/martinfrancois/question-driven-talk-assistant/security/advisories/new) tab.

After your report is received, I will acknowledge it and provide information on the next steps. Throughout the process, I will keep you informed about the progress toward a fix and may request additional information or guidance as needed.

If you discover security issues in third-party modules that this project depends on, please report them to the maintainers of those modules. You can also report vulnerabilities through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability."
