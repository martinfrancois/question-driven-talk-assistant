# Contributing to Question-Driven Talk Assistant <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to my project! :sparkles:

Read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a community that is approachable and respectful.

This guide provides an overview of the contribution workflow, from opening an issue to creating a pull request (PR), reviewing it, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md) file. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

Refer to the [development setup](./README.md#development-setup) for details on the project structure, scripts, and development environment.

Before making changes, review the existing [issues](https://github.com/martinfrancois/question-driven-talk-assistant/issues) to see the types of contributions that are welcome. Improvements to code, documentation, and tests are all appreciated.

## Conventions

- Unit/integration tests are in the same folder as the code, with the same filename as the file that is tested, ending in `.spec.ts`/`.spec.tsx`
- Mocks for unit/integration tests are in the src/**mocks** folder
- Property-based tests with fast-check are in a separate file ending in `.property.spec.ts`
- Automated end-to-end tests using Playwright are in the `e2e` folder, and are using the page object pattern.
  - Page objects are in the `pageobjects` subfolder.
  - All page objects extend `AppPage`
  - Test files end with `.spec.ts`
- File name conventions:
  - React components: PascalCase with `.tsx` suffix.
  - Pure logic/utils/zhooks/constants/etc.: kebab-case with `.ts` suffix.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, please open a new one using a relevant template before submitting a pull request unless the change is truly trivial (for example, typo fixes or removing compiler warnings). Trivial changes don't need an issue or tests.

#### Solve an issue

Browse the [existing issues](https://github.com/martinfrancois/question-driven-talk-assistant/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow the search using labels as filters. I add the `help wanted` label to issues where community contributions are especially welcome and the `good first issue` label for tasks suited to new contributors. If you'd like to work on an issue, first leave a comment asking if you can work on it. I will assign the issue to you, and once assigned, you can start working on it and open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

You can make small changes, such as a typo or a broken link, directly through the GitHub UI by clicking **Edit this file** on the page. This will create a fork and let you [create a pull request](#pull-request) for review.

#### Make changes in a codespace

You can open this project in a [GitHub codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for a full-featured online development environment.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository:
   - Go to <https://github.com/martinfrancois/question-driven-talk-assistant>.
   - Hit the **Fork** button and choose your own GitHub account as the target. Make sure the box 'Copy main branch' is checked.
   - For more details, see [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
2. Clone your fork.
3. Follow the [development setup](./README.md#development-setup) in the README to install dependencies and set up your environment. Installing dependencies also sets up a pre-commit hook that formats staged files with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
4. Create a working branch and start making your changes.

### Commit your update

Commit your changes and run through this self-review checklist before submitting your PR (you can skip these for trivial changes like typos):

```
bun lint
bun x tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit
bun run build
bun run test:unit
bun x playwright install --with-deps
bun run preview -- --port 5173  # run this in a separate terminal window and keep it open
bun run test:e2e
```

#### Commit message style

Write commit messages that follow [these guidelines](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

### Pull Request

Once you've finished your changes, create a pull request.

- Fill out the pull request template so that reviewers can understand your changes.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you're solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, maintainers will review your proposal and may ask questions or request additional information.

- Maintainers may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge conflicts, check out this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve them.
